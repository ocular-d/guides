It's OK to use phrasing like "we recommend" if it helps you avoid awkward phrasing like "it's recommended",
but write around it if you can.

## Clause order

When giving instructions, follow this clause order:

1. goal first
2. then location
3. then action

Mentioning the goal or circumstance first lets the user skip the instruction if it doesn't apply.

Instead of: Click Remove on the Sidebar to delete the document  
Use: To delete the document, on the Sidebar, click Remove.

## Paragraphs

The first sentence of a paragraph is a topic sentence describing that paragraph's central idea. State that idea upfront, then build on it. When reading technical documentation, users often look for a specific piece of information. When they know the topic, users can skip the paragraph if that paragraph's information is irrelevant to their needs.

Never assume users have read every word in the preceding paragraph. Don't start a paragraph with a pronoun or words like but or however. Every paragraph should encapsulate an idea that can stand on its own.

Try to limit paragraphs to 4-5 sentences. Follow the 1:1 rule: one paragraph, one idea. Remove any sentences that neither clarify the idea in that paragraph, nor logically connect this paragraph and the next.
